Hi!

The final project code is :Final_project_Nbody (duh)

The video problem1.avi, problem2.avi, problem3_periodic.avi, problem3_nperiodic.avi and problem4.avi are the simulation of each part of the problem set.

Note : I accidently overwrite the video for part 3 with periodic boundaries, but I had (to show to my friend) take a video of it using my cell phone. That's why the video format is a bit "different"

Note 2: I finish at 11:59 my code, but it took me an hour to be able to convert the (too heavy) .avi into  (lighter) .gif
